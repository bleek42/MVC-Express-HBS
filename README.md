# üèóÔ∏è  MVC with Express, Handlebars , Bulma CSS, Sequelize, & Common Middlewaress



## I don't know where I am really going with this...

* Just not super familiar with Handlebars, and thought I'd take the time to implement my own creation using it.
* I do know ExpressJS very well, though I'd say, so taking what I know beyond what is being taught to students I have.
* This includes, but is not limited to: Express middlewares like helmet, winston, next() functions in routers, & mocha/chai testing libs.

## INSTRUCTIONS
- clone repository
- run the command 'npm install' in the root folder
- run the command 'npm run postinstall' to initialize a base local env file with the included shell script
- make this do stuff & look nice
